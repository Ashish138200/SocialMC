#### In this project, three apps are used to build this web application completely and each have totally different functionality.
* ##### __Accounts:__  This application manages the accounts of the users and provide authentication and authorization (superusers only). All the account information is stored through the models in the database and can be managed through the Django admin page. The password of users is encrypted with a hash key which uses AES 256-bit encryption even the super user canâ€™t see password of other users.
* ##### __Groups:__ This application manages the groups like creation or deletion of a group, member and post count in a particular group. The data of accounts app is used to know that who is logged in and in which group the user is present.
* ##### __Posts:__ This application handles the posts which are posted by the users and at which date and time. All this is done by the Django models and delivered to the templates using Django views.
